# Symbol Upgrade Mechanic

The **Symbol Upgrade** mechanic is a feature in slot games where certain symbols are upgraded to higher-value symbols during gameplay, increasing the potential for bigger wins. This mechanic can occur randomly or be triggered by specific symbols or bonus features, transforming lower-paying symbols into higher-paying ones or even wilds, thereby enhancing the chances of landing high-value winning combinations.

## Key Features

- **Upgrading Symbols**: When the symbol upgrade mechanic is activated, selected symbols on the reels are transformed into higher-value symbols. This could involve upgrading lower-paying symbols into medium- or high-paying symbols, or even turning them into wilds.

- **Triggering the Mechanic**: The symbol upgrade can be triggered in several ways:
  - Randomly during a spin in the base game.
  - As part of a bonus round or free spins feature.
  - By landing specific symbols, such as scatters or special upgrade symbols.
  
- **Enhanced Win Potential**: By upgrading symbols, the mechanic increases the likelihood of forming high-value combinations. When lower-paying symbols are replaced with higher-paying ones, the payout potential increases significantly.

- **Bonus Round Integration**: In many games, the symbol upgrade mechanic becomes more prominent during bonus rounds or free spins, where multiple symbols may be upgraded simultaneously for the duration of the feature.

## How It Works

1. **Spin the Reels**: The player spins the reels as usual, and when the symbol upgrade mechanic is triggered, selected symbols on the grid are upgraded to higher-paying symbols.

2. **Symbol Transformation**: The game chooses one or more symbols on the reels to upgrade. These lower-paying symbols transform into higher-value ones, such as mid-tier symbols, top-tier symbols, or wilds.

3. **New Winning Combinations**: Once the symbols are upgraded, the game reevaluates the grid to check for new or enhanced winning combinations. The upgraded symbols now contribute to larger payouts.

4. **Payout Calculation**: The payout is calculated based on the upgraded symbols, which increases the overall win potential for that spin or bonus round.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Symbol Upgrade** mechanic:
- A free spins bonus round is triggered, and during the free spins, all low-paying "A" symbols are upgraded to high-paying "Golden Crown" symbols.
- As the reels spin, the upgraded symbols help form higher-value combinations, leading to significantly bigger payouts than the standard "A" symbols would have provided.

## Example Games

- **Legacy of Dead** by Play’n GO: During the free spins bonus, a special expanding symbol is chosen, and it can be upgraded to a high-paying symbol, increasing win potential significantly.
- **Rise of Olympus** by Play’n GO: Features a symbol upgrade mechanic where lower-paying symbols can be upgraded to higher-paying ones during the bonus rounds.

## Conclusion

The **Symbol Upgrade** mechanic adds an exciting twist to slot gameplay by transforming low-value symbols into high-paying ones, increasing the chances of landing more valuable winning combinations. This mechanic often enhances the player's win potential, especially during bonus rounds or free spins, offering a rewarding experience with the possibility of significantly boosted payouts. Whether triggered randomly or through specific features, symbol upgrades keep the game dynamic and engaging.
