# Reel Swap Mechanic

The **Reel Swap** mechanic is a unique slot feature where reels are swapped with one another during or after a spin, often resulting in improved symbol alignment and enhanced winning combinations. This mechanic creates new opportunities for players to land winning lines by shifting or swapping reels into more advantageous positions. Reel swaps can occur randomly or be triggered by specific events, adding a layer of unpredictability and excitement to the game.

## Key Features

- **Reel Swapping**: During a reel swap, one or more reels switch places with others on the grid. This rearrangement can lead to better symbol alignments and create new winning combinations that would not have occurred in the original reel layout.

- **Random or Triggered Activation**: The reel swap can occur randomly during regular gameplay or be triggered by specific symbols, such as wilds, scatters, or bonus symbols. In some games, the feature may only be active during bonus rounds or free spins.

- **Increased Win Potential**: By changing the positioning of the reels, the reel swap mechanic boosts the chances of landing winning combinations. This feature is particularly beneficial when higher-paying symbols or wilds are swapped into favorable positions.

- **Bonus Round Integration**: Reel swaps are often part of special bonus features or free spins rounds, where reels may swap more frequently or in more complex patterns, offering even greater chances of big wins.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Spin**: The player spins the reels as usual. Once the reels stop, the symbols are evaluated for any initial winning combinations.

2. **Reel Swap Activation**: If the reel swap mechanic is triggered (either randomly or by landing specific symbols), one or more reels swap places with others. This swap may involve adjacent reels or any combination of reels on the grid.

3. **New Reel Layout**: After the reels swap, the game reevaluates the new symbol alignment for potential winning combinations. The newly positioned reels may form winning paylines that were not possible before the swap.

4. **Payout Calculation**: Once the reel swap is complete and any new winning combinations are formed, the player is awarded payouts based on the updated reel configuration.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Reel Swap** mechanic:
- After a spin, reels 2 and 4 swap positions.
- The symbols on reel 2 (previously reel 4) now align with symbols on reels 1 and 3, creating a high-paying combination that wouldn’t have occurred without the swap.
- The player is awarded a large payout based on the new winning combination formed by the swapped reels.

## Example Games

- **The Wild Chase** by Quickspin: Features a reel swap mechanic during bonus rounds where reels can swap positions to help form winning combinations and boost payouts.
- **Dr Fortuno** by Yggdrasil: Incorporates a reel swap feature during its special bonus rounds, where random reels swap places to improve win potential.

## Conclusion

The **Reel Swap** mechanic adds an exciting twist to slot gameplay by rearranging the reels to create new winning possibilities. Whether triggered randomly or during a bonus feature, reel swaps give players an extra chance to land high-value combinations that wouldn’t have been possible in the original reel layout. This mechanic increases unpredictability and engagement, making each spin more dynamic and offering the potential for bigger wins.
