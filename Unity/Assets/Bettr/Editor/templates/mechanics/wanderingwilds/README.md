# Wandering Wilds Mechanic

The **Wandering Wilds** mechanic is a slot feature where wild symbols move or "wander" across the reels over consecutive spins, typically remaining on the reels for several spins. As the wilds move from one position to another, they help form new winning combinations by substituting for other symbols. This feature can be triggered in both the base game and bonus rounds, enhancing the excitement and win potential.

## Key Features

- **Moving Wilds**: Instead of staying fixed in one position, wandering wilds shift across the reels with each spin. They usually move one position at a time—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—until they eventually disappear from the reels.

- **Multiple Spins**: Wandering wilds typically remain on the reels for several spins, moving across the grid with each subsequent spin. This creates multiple opportunities for the wilds to contribute to winning combinations over a series of spins.

- **Triggering the Feature**: The wandering wilds mechanic can be triggered randomly or as part of a special feature such as free spins or bonus rounds. In some games, certain symbols or combinations trigger the wandering wilds to appear and move.

- **Increased Win Potential**: Since the wandering wilds move across the reels and stay in play for several spins, they increase the likelihood of forming winning combinations over consecutive spins. This is especially valuable in games with multiple paylines or cascading reels.

## How It Works

1. **Wild Appears on the Reels**: The wandering wild symbol lands on the reels during a spin, either randomly or as part of a triggered feature like free spins or a bonus round.

2. **Wandering Movement**: After each spin, the wandering wild moves to a different adjacent position (usually to the left, right, up, or down). The wild continues to move across the reels for a set number of spins, contributing to new winning combinations as it moves.

3. **Winnings Accumulation**: With each spin, the wild symbol helps form new winning combinations by substituting for other symbols, and the player receives payouts for these combinations.

4. **End of Wandering**: The wandering wilds continue to move across the reels for a predetermined number of spins. Once the wild has reached its final position or the feature ends, it disappears from the reels.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Wandering Wilds** mechanic:
- A wild symbol lands on reel 4 during a spin and triggers the wandering wilds feature.
- The wild shifts one position to the left with each spin, moving across reels 3, 2, and 1 over the next three spins.
- As the wild wanders, it helps create new winning combinations by substituting for other symbols on the paylines.
- After the wild reaches reel 1 and no further spins remain, it disappears from the grid.

## Example Games

- **Wild Toro** by ELK Studios: Features wandering wilds where the Toro symbol moves across the reels, creating wilds in its path and triggering re-spins for added win potential.
- **Jack and the Beanstalk** by NetEnt: Includes wandering wilds during free spins, where wild symbols shift from right to left with each spin, remaining in play for several spins to create new winning combinations.

## Conclusion

The **Wandering Wilds** mechanic adds an engaging and dynamic twist to traditional wild symbols by allowing them to move across the reels over consecutive spins. This feature increases the player's chances of forming winning combinations across multiple spins, creating excitement and boosting win potential. Whether triggered randomly or during a bonus feature, wandering wilds offer a unique and rewarding slot experience.
