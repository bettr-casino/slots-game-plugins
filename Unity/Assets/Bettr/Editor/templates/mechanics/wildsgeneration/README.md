# Wilds Generation Mechanic

The **Wilds Generation** mechanic is a feature in slot games where certain symbols or events trigger the creation or generation of new wild symbols. This mechanic enhances gameplay by turning specific symbols, reels, or even entire areas of the grid into wilds, increasing the chances of forming winning combinations. Wilds Generation can occur randomly during the base game or be triggered by specific features, such as bonus rounds or special symbols.

## Key Features

- **Symbol Transformation into Wilds**: In the Wilds Generation mechanic, specific symbols or groups of symbols can transform into wild symbols, helping players form new winning combinations. These transformations can occur randomly or as part of a triggered feature.

- **Random or Triggered Activation**: The mechanic can be activated randomly during a spin, or it can be triggered by landing special symbols, such as bonus symbols or wilds. In some games, Wilds Generation may be a guaranteed feature during free spins or other bonus rounds.

- **Wild Multiplication**: Some games allow for a chain reaction of wilds, where one wild symbol generates additional wilds on the reels. This can significantly increase win potential by spreading wilds across the grid.

- **Bonus Feature Enhancement**: The Wilds Generation mechanic is often integrated into bonus rounds or free spins, where it may be more frequent or more powerful. For example, wilds may continue to generate more wilds throughout a series of spins, leading to larger payouts.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger the Wilds Generation**: The Wilds Generation mechanic can be triggered randomly or by landing specific symbols. Once activated, certain symbols on the grid will transform into wilds.

2. **Creation of Wilds**: The designated symbols transform into wilds, or new wild symbols are generated in random positions on the reels. These wilds then substitute for other symbols to create or improve winning combinations.

3. **Potential for Chain Reaction**: In some games, Wilds Generation can lead to a chain reaction, where wild symbols generate even more wilds. This can cover larger sections of the grid and dramatically increase the win potential.

4. **Payout Calculation**: Once the wilds are generated and any additional wilds are created, the game calculates the payouts for all winning combinations formed with the wilds.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Wilds Generation** mechanic:
- The player lands a special "wild generator" symbol on the reels, triggering the mechanic.
- The wild generator symbol transforms itself and two adjacent symbols into wilds, significantly increasing the player's chances of landing a winning combination.
- The player is awarded a large payout as the wilds form multiple winning combinations across several paylines.

## Example Games

- **Raging Rhino** by WMS: Features a Wilds Generation mechanic during free spins, where wild symbols appear more frequently and can create additional wilds.
- **Jack and the Beanstalk** by NetEnt: Includes a Wilds Generation mechanic where special symbols generate wilds that move across the reels during the bonus rounds, increasing win potential.

## Conclusion

The **Wilds Generation** mechanic adds a thrilling and dynamic element to slot gameplay by creating new wild symbols, either randomly or through specific triggers. This mechanic significantly boosts win potential by increasing the number of wilds on the reels, often turning non-winning combinations into big payouts. Whether part of a bonus round or a random feature, Wilds Generation keeps players engaged and excited by offering enhanced chances for large wins.
