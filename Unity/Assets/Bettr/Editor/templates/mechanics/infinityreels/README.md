# Infinity Reels Mechanic

The **Infinity Reels** mechanic is an innovative slot feature where the number of reels can expand infinitely, creating limitless potential for forming winning combinations. This mechanic adds new reels to the grid each time a winning combination is formed, allowing players to extend the reels endlessly as long as they continue landing wins. This mechanic provides players with a dynamic and ever-growing reel set, increasing the excitement and win potential with every spin.

## Key Features

- **Infinite Reel Expansion**: With the Infinity Reels mechanic, additional reels are added to the right side of the grid whenever a winning combination is formed. Each new reel increases the number of ways to win, as the grid keeps expanding with more symbols.

- **Reel Addition with Wins**: The mechanic is activated when a winning combination is formed. Instead of the game ending after the spin, a new reel is added, and the process continues as long as new wins are formed with the added reels.

- **Multiplier Increase**: In many Infinity Reels games, a win multiplier increases with each new reel added, leading to larger payouts as the reels expand. The multiplier can grow indefinitely as more reels are added, further enhancing the win potential.

- **Limitless Win Potential**: Since the reels can theoretically expand infinitely, the win potential is also limitless. As long as new reels continue to land matching symbols or extend winning combinations, the player can continue accumulating wins.

- **Bonus Integration**: The Infinity Reels mechanic often interacts with bonus rounds or free spins features. In some cases, expanding reels can trigger free spins or unlock special rewards, adding even more excitement to the mechanic.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Spin**: The player spins the reels, which start with a standard number of reels (typically three). 

2. **Reel Expansion**: When a winning combination is formed, an additional reel is added to the right of the grid. The new reel can continue the winning combination, and if it does, another reel is added.

3. **Continued Expansion**: The reels keep expanding as long as new winning symbols land on the newly added reels. The more reels that are added, the larger the number of ways to win, and in some games, the win multiplier increases with each reel expansion.

4. **End of Expansion**: The expansion continues until no new winning symbols land on the added reel. At this point, the reels reset back to the original number, and the player is awarded their total payout.

## Example

In a slot featuring the **Infinity Reels** mechanic:
- The player starts with a 3-reel grid.
- A winning combination of symbols lands, and a new reel is added to the right.
- The new reel continues the win by adding matching symbols, and another reel is added.
- This process repeats, with each new reel increasing the win multiplier, until no new matching symbols land.
- The player receives a payout based on the number of reels expanded and the accumulated multiplier.

## Example Games

- **El Dorado Infinity Reels** by ReelPlay: One of the first games to feature this mechanic, with additional reels being added after each win and an increasing multiplier for each new reel.
- **Gods of Gold Infinity Reels** by NetEnt: Expands the reel set with each win and features an infinite multiplier, making the win potential limitless.

## Conclusion

The **Infinity Reels** mechanic adds an exciting and dynamic element to slot gameplay by offering limitless reel expansion and win potential. With the possibility of adding new reels indefinitely, players can extend winning combinations across an ever-growing grid, often with increasing multipliers to boost payouts. This mechanic offers a unique and thrilling gaming experience, as each spin has the potential to unlock endless reels and massive wins.
