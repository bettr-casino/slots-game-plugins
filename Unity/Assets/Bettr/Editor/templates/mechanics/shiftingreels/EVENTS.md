## Shifting Reels Events

### 1. Shifting Reels Triggered
**Event Description**: This event is triggered when the player lands a winning combination, activating the **Shifting Reels** mechanic.

- **Trigger Condition**: A winning combination is formed on the reels.
- **Effect**: The reels begin to shift horizontally (or vertically), moving all symbols by one position. New symbols fill the empty spaces.
- **Impact**: This provides an additional opportunity to form new winning combinations without requiring an extra spin.

### 2. Shifting Reels Movement (Unison)
**Event Description**: All reels shift **in unison**, moving one position to the right (for horizontal shifts) or downward (for vertical shifts).

- **Trigger Condition**: After the initial win, the reels shift together in unison.
- **Effect**: All reels shift simultaneously, and new symbols appear on the leftmost reel (or top, depending on the shift direction).
- **Impact**: The synchronized movement creates the possibility for new winning combinations, with a smooth visual effect that enhances the gameplay experience.

### 3. New Symbols Enter
**Event Description**: New symbols fill the empty positions on the reels after the shift, replacing the symbols that have moved.

- **Trigger Condition**: After the reels shift, new symbols appear in the vacated positions on the grid.
- **Effect**: The game fills the leftmost reel (or the top row for vertical shifts) with new symbols, which may create new winning combinations.
- **Impact**: New symbols increase the potential for consecutive wins in a single spin, keeping the player's chances of winning high.

### 4. Reevaluation for New Wins
**Event Description**: The game reevaluates the new symbol positions after each shift to determine if a new winning combination has been formed.

- **Trigger Condition**: After the reels shift and new symbols enter, the game checks for new winning combinations.
- **Effect**: If new winning combinations are formed, the **Shifting Reels** mechanic triggers again, shifting the reels for another chance to win.
- **Impact**: This allows the player to chain together multiple consecutive wins from a single spin, adding excitement and increasing potential payouts.

### 5. Win Multiplier Increases
**Event Description**: In some games, a win multiplier increases with each successful shift, boosting payouts for consecutive wins.

- **Trigger Condition**: After each successful shift that results in a new win, the win multiplier increases.
- **Effect**: The win multiplier applies to subsequent payouts, providing larger rewards for consecutive wins.
- **Impact**: The multiplier increases the excitement and potential for bigger payouts, especially during extended sequences of wins.

### 6. End of Shifts
**Event Description**: The shifting reels mechanic ends when no new winning combinations are formed after a shift.

- **Trigger Condition**: The game reevaluates the reels and finds no new winning combinations after a shift.
- **Effect**: The reels return to a neutral state, and the player is awarded the total payout from the initial spin and all consecutive wins.
- **Impact**: The player receives the final payout, including any accumulated win multipliers.
