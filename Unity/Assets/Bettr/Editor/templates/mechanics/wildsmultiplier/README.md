# Wilds Multiplier Mechanic

The **Wilds Multiplier** mechanic is a common and exciting feature in slot machines where wild symbols not only substitute for other symbols to help form winning combinations but also multiply the payout of any winning combination they are part of. This mechanic increases the potential payout significantly, especially when multiple wilds or multipliers are involved in the same win.

## Key Features

- **Substitute and Multiply**: Wild symbols act as substitutes for other regular symbols, helping to form winning combinations. In addition, these wilds apply a multiplier to the payout, such as 2x, 3x, or higher, enhancing the win.

- **Fixed or Variable Multipliers**: Some games feature fixed multiplier wilds (e.g., 2x wilds that always double the win), while others assign a random multiplier (e.g., anywhere between 2x and 5x) when the wild appears in a winning combination.

- **Multiple Wilds, Multiple Multipliers**: When more than one wild is part of a winning combination, the multipliers can either stack (added together) or multiply each other, significantly boosting the total payout. For example, two wilds with 2x multipliers could combine to create a 4x multiplier.

- **Base Game and Bonus Feature Integration**: Wild multiplier mechanics can appear in both the base game and bonus features like free spins. In bonus rounds, wilds often carry larger multipliers, increasing the chances of big payouts.

## How It Works

1. **Wild Substitution**: During a spin, a wild symbol lands on the reels and substitutes for any missing regular symbol in a winning combination, helping form the win.

2. **Multiplier Application**: In addition to substituting, the wild applies a multiplier to the win. For example, if a wild with a 3x multiplier is part of a winning combination, the win is multiplied by 3.

3. **Multiple Wilds, Bigger Multipliers**: If more than one wild appears in a single winning combination, the multipliers are either added together or multiplied. For instance, if a win involves two wilds with 2x and 3x multipliers, the total multiplier could either be 5x (added) or 6x (multiplied), depending on the game's rules.

4. **Win Payout**: The final payout is calculated by applying the wild multiplier(s) to the original win, resulting in enhanced payouts.

## Example

In a slot game featuring **Wilds Multiplier**:
- A wild symbol with a 2x multiplier appears on reel 3 and forms part of a winning combination that would normally pay 10 coins.
- The wild doubles the payout, resulting in a win of 20 coins (10 x 2).
- If another wild with a 3x multiplier is part of the same win, the two wilds multiply together, creating a 6x multiplier, and the final payout becomes 60 coins (10 x 6).

## Example Games

- **Twin Spin** by NetEnt: Features multiplier wilds during free spins, where the presence of wilds can boost payouts significantly.
- **Immortal Romance** by Microgaming: Has multiplier wilds during its various bonus rounds, with different multipliers depending on the chosen feature.

## Conclusion

The **Wilds Multiplier** mechanic offers players enhanced win potential by not only substituting for other symbols but also applying a multiplier to the payout. Whether through fixed or random multipliers, the ability to multiply wins makes wilds a powerful feature in slot games, especially when multiple wilds combine to increase the total multiplier. This mechanic is commonly used in both base games and bonus rounds to deliver bigger and more exciting payouts.
