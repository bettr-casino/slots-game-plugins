# Expanding Reels Mechanics

Expanding Reels is a slot machine mechanic where the number of rows on the reels increases during the game, leading to more ways to win. The reels start with a standard number of rows and can expand either progressively or through triggered features such as specific symbols or bonuses.

## Key Features

- **Reel Expansion**: The height (number of rows) of each reel increases during gameplay, typically triggered by specific conditions such as landing a special symbol, achieving consecutive wins, or during a bonus round. Each expansion adds more ways to win.
  
- **Fixed Number of Reels**: Unlike Megaways, the number of reels remains fixed. It's the number of rows (height) on each reel that changes, which results in more paylines or ways to win as the reels expand.

- **Triggered Feature**: The reel expansion usually happens when certain symbols appear, or during free spins and bonus rounds. Some games may have progressive expansion that grows over multiple spins.

- **Increased Win Potential**: As the reels expand, the number of possible winning combinations increases, enhancing the potential for bigger wins.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**: The game starts with a fixed number of reels and rows. The player spins the reels normally, and winning combinations are evaluated based on the default configuration.
  
2. **Trigger Expansion**: Once a specific feature is triggered (such as a special symbol or consecutive wins), the reels expand vertically, adding extra rows and increasing the number of ways to win.

3. **Expanded Wins**: As the reels grow, more paylines or ways to win are activated. In some games, the reels can return to their original size after the feature ends, while in others, the expansion might remain for the duration of the bonus round.

## Example

In a game with Expanding Reels, you might start with a 5x3 grid (5 reels, 3 rows). After triggering the expanding feature, the reels may grow to 5x6 (5 reels, 6 rows), adding more ways to win. The exact expansion depends on the game and its specific mechanics.

## Example Games

- **Reel Rush** by NetEnt: Starts with fewer symbols and expands the reel size with consecutive wins.
- **Divine Fortune Megaways**: Features expanding reels during its bonus rounds, adding rows and increasing winning opportunities.

## Conclusion

Expanding Reels slots add excitement by gradually increasing the number of ways to win during gameplay. This mechanic is often tied to bonus features or special symbols, and the expanding grid can lead to bigger payouts. The reel expansion provides a dynamic and engaging experience, where the potential for larger wins grows as the game progresses.
