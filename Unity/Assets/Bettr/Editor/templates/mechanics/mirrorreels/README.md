# Mirror Reels Mechanic

The **Mirror Reels** mechanic is a slot machine feature where two or more reels mirror each other's symbols, displaying identical results during a spin. Unlike locked reels, where adjacent reels spin in sync, mirror reels reflect the same symbols across designated reels, typically from one side of the slot grid to the other. This mechanic enhances the chances of landing high-paying combinations by increasing symbol alignment across multiple reels.

## Key Features

- **Mirrored Symbols**: When the mirror reels mechanic is triggered, the symbols on one reel are mirrored onto one or more other reels. This creates identical symbol alignment across the mirrored reels, improving the potential for winning combinations.

- **Random or Triggered Feature**: Mirror reels can be triggered randomly during the base game or activated as part of a bonus round or free spins. Some slots have mirror reels activated on every spin during specific features, while others trigger it at random intervals.

- **Increased Win Potential**: By displaying identical symbols across mirrored reels, the mechanic increases the probability of matching symbols on adjacent reels, leading to more winning combinations and larger payouts, especially when high-value symbols or wilds are involved.

- **Flexible Application**: Mirror reels may reflect symbols between two reels or across multiple reels depending on the game. The mirrored reels can also shift position during free spins or remain fixed for the duration of the bonus feature.

## How It Works

1. **Activation**: The mirror reels mechanic can activate randomly during a spin or as part of a bonus feature like free spins. When triggered, one or more reels mirror the symbols displayed on another reel.
  
2. **Mirroring Symbols**: Once activated, the symbols on one reel are copied onto one or more designated reels, creating identical reels across the grid. This increases the chances of forming matching combinations.

3. **Payouts**: After the reels stop, winning combinations are evaluated, and the player receives payouts based on the mirrored symbols across the affected reels. The mirrored reels can lead to significant wins, especially if high-paying symbols are mirrored.

## Example

In a slot featuring the **Mirror Reels** mechanic:
- During a spin, reel 1 displays a series of symbols.
- Reel 5 mirrors reel 1, showing the exact same symbols.
- As a result, the mirrored reels create identical symbol alignment, increasing the chances of forming high-value winning combinations across multiple paylines.

## Example Games

- **Vikings Unleashed Megaways** by Blueprint Gaming: Features a mirror reels mechanic during certain bonus rounds, where reels mirror each other to enhance winning potential.
- **Book of Gods** by Big Time Gaming: Includes mirror reels, where specific reels mirror symbols from other reels, boosting the chances of landing matching combinations.

## Conclusion

The **Mirror Reels** mechanic offers an exciting twist to traditional slot gameplay by reflecting identical symbols across multiple reels, significantly increasing the chances of landing high-paying combinations. Whether triggered randomly or during bonus rounds, the mirrored reels can create numerous winning opportunities, making this mechanic a valuable and engaging feature for players seeking larger payouts and dynamic gameplay.
