# Cascading Reels Mechanics

Cascading Reels is a slot machine mechanic where winning symbols disappear from the reels, allowing new symbols to fall into place. This creates the possibility of multiple wins on a single spin as new combinations are formed. Cascading Reels is also known as Avalanche, Tumbling, or Rolling Reels, depending on the game developer.

## Key Features

- **Symbol Removal**: After a winning combination is formed, the winning symbols are removed from the reels, leaving empty spaces for new symbols to cascade down and fill the gaps.

- **Chain Reactions**: With each cascade, new symbols fall into place, potentially creating new winning combinations. This process can continue as long as new wins are formed, allowing for multiple consecutive wins from a single spin.

- **No New Spin Required**: Cascading Reels operate within a single spin. As long as new winning combinations keep forming, the cascades will continue without requiring another spin or bet.

- **Multiplier Feature**: Some Cascading Reels games include a multiplier feature, where each successive cascade increases the multiplier, enhancing the payout for any subsequent wins in the chain reaction.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Spin**: The player spins the reels, and the initial winning combinations are evaluated and paid out.

2. **Cascading Feature**: Once a win occurs, the winning symbols disappear, and new symbols fall from above to fill the empty spaces.

3. **Repeated Cascades**: If the new symbols form another winning combination, the process repeats, with the symbols disappearing and being replaced. This continues until no new winning combinations are formed.

4. **End of Cascade**: When no further winning combinations are created, the cascade ends, and the player can initiate the next spin.

## Example

In a typical 5-reel, 3-row slot game with Cascading Reels:
- You land a winning combination of symbols on the first spin.
- The winning symbols are removed, and new symbols drop down to replace them.
- If the new symbols create another win, they disappear, and more symbols fall into place, potentially continuing the chain reaction.

## Example Games

- **Gonzo's Quest** by NetEnt: One of the first games to introduce Cascading Reels, with increasing multipliers on consecutive wins.
- **Bonanza Megaways** by Big Time Gaming: Features cascading reels with a dynamic reel structure, adding excitement and win potential with each cascade.

## Conclusion

Cascading Reels add an extra layer of excitement to slots by allowing multiple consecutive wins on a single spin. With the possibility of chain reactions and potential multipliers, this mechanic creates a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience that increases the potential for larger payouts.
