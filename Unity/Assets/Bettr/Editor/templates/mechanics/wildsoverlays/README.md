# WildsOverlay Mechanic

The **WildsOverlay** mechanic is a feature in slot games where wild symbols are overlaid on top of existing symbols on the reels, often at random, to increase the player's chances of forming winning combinations. This mechanic enhances the win potential by turning non-wild symbols into wilds, which substitute for other symbols to create or improve winning paylines. WildsOverlay can occur during the base game or be part of a bonus feature, such as free spins.

## Key Features

- **Overlay Wilds**: Wild symbols are placed over the top of regular symbols on the reels. These wilds substitute for other symbols, helping to form or complete winning combinations. The original symbols beneath the overlay remain unchanged, but the wilds take precedence in determining winning combinations.

- **Random or Triggered Activation**: WildsOverlay can occur randomly during regular gameplay or be triggered by specific conditions, such as landing certain symbols, entering a bonus round, or activating free spins. In some games, the feature might be guaranteed during special rounds, adding to the excitement.

- **Increased Win Potential**: By transforming regular symbols into wilds, the WildsOverlay increases the likelihood of landing high-value combinations across multiple paylines. This is particularly beneficial when wild overlays land on high-value symbols, boosting the overall payout.

- **Bonus Round Enhancements**: In many games, WildsOverlay is more frequent or more powerful during free spins or bonus rounds. In these scenarios, wild overlays might cover entire reels or multiple symbols, further increasing the win potential.

## How It Works

1. **Triggering the Feature**: The WildsOverlay mechanic can be triggered randomly during regular gameplay or by entering a bonus feature such as free spins. Once triggered, wild symbols are placed on top of existing symbols on the reels.

2. **Overlaying the Wilds**: The game places wild symbols over the top of selected regular symbols. These wilds substitute for other symbols to help create or improve winning combinations, boosting the player's payout potential.

3. **Reevaluating the Reels**: After the wild overlays are placed, the game reevaluates the reels to determine any new winning combinations. The player is awarded payouts based on the new combinations formed by the WildsOverlay.

4. **Bonus Round Integration**: During bonus rounds, such as free spins, WildsOverlay may appear more frequently or cover larger areas of the reels, greatly enhancing the chances of landing multiple winning combinations.

## Example

In a game featuring the **WildsOverlay** mechanic:
- The player enters a free spins round.
- During one of the free spins, the WildsOverlay feature is triggered, and wild symbols are randomly placed over symbols on reels 2, 3, and 4.
- These wild overlays help form multiple winning combinations across various paylines, leading to a significantly larger payout for the player.

## Example Games

- **Immortal Romance** by Microgaming: Features a WildsOverlay mechanic during its bonus rounds, where random wilds are placed on the reels to enhance winning combinations.
- **Vikings Go Berzerk** by Yggdrasil: Includes WildsOverlay during free spins, where wilds are randomly placed over symbols, increasing win potential.

## Conclusion

The **WildsOverlay** mechanic adds an exciting dynamic to slot gameplay by placing wild symbols over existing symbols, turning non-winning or low-value combinations into potential big wins. By increasing the chances of landing wilds across the reels, this mechanic boosts the player's chances of forming valuable combinations. Whether triggered randomly or during bonus rounds, WildsOverlay enhances the excitement and win potential, making for more engaging and rewarding gameplay.
