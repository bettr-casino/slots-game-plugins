# Symbol Swap Mechanic

The **Symbol Swap** mechanic is a dynamic feature in slot machines where certain symbols on the reels are swapped with others, potentially creating or enhancing winning combinations. This swap can occur randomly during the base game or be triggered by special conditions, such as a bonus round or specific symbol landing. The swapped symbols are replaced with higher-paying symbols or wilds, increasing the player's chances of winning.

## Key Features

- **Random or Triggered Symbol Swaps**: Symbols can be swapped at random or as part of a triggered feature, such as free spins or bonus rounds. During the swap, lower-value symbols may be replaced with higher-paying symbols, wilds, or other valuable icons.

- **Win Enhancement**: The symbol swap can significantly boost win potential by turning non-winning combinations into winning ones or by improving existing wins by introducing higher-paying symbols.

- **Base and Bonus Game Usage**: The symbol swap mechanic may appear in both the base game and bonus features. In some games, the swap is more frequent or impactful during bonus rounds, such as free spins, leading to higher payouts.

- **Full or Partial Reel Swap**: In some games, the symbol swap might affect a single reel or column, while in others, it can involve multiple reels or even the entire grid, increasing the win potential even further.

## How It Works

1. **Symbol Selection**: During a spin, certain symbols are chosen for the swap, either randomly or due to a triggered condition. These symbols are typically low-paying or non-winning icons.

2. **Symbol Swap**: The selected symbols are then replaced with higher-paying symbols or wilds. This swap can turn a near-miss or non-winning combination into a winning one, or it can increase the payout of an already existing win.

3. **Winning Potential**: Once the symbols are swapped, new or improved winning combinations are evaluated, and the player receives the payout for any new wins that have been formed.

## Example

In a slot featuring the **Symbol Swap** mechanic:
- After a spin, a low-paying "J" symbol appears in multiple positions.
- The game randomly selects these "J" symbols and swaps them for higher-paying "A" symbols, resulting in new winning combinations across several paylines.
- The player wins a larger payout thanks to the symbol swap feature.

## Example Games

- **Gonzo's Quest** by NetEnt: Features cascading symbols with random symbol swaps to enhance winning combinations.
- **Temple Tumble Megaways** by Relax Gaming: Uses symbol swaps during its bonus rounds, where certain symbols are replaced to increase win potential.

## Conclusion

The **Symbol Swap** mechanic offers an exciting and rewarding feature by transforming low-value or non-winning symbols into higher-value ones, significantly boosting the chances of forming winning combinations. Whether randomly triggered or part of a bonus feature, symbol swaps can turn a losing spin into a winning one, making it a valuable and engaging mechanic in slot gameplay.
