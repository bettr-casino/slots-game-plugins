# Scatter Respins Feature

The **Scatter Respins** feature is a slot mechanic where landing a certain number of scatter symbols triggers a respin or series of respins. During the respins, the scatter symbols usually remain locked in place, while the other reels spin again, giving players additional chances to land more scatter symbols or improve their overall win. The ultimate goal of this feature is often to collect more scatters, which can lead to bonus rounds, free spins, or jackpot wins.

## Key Features

- **Triggered by Scatter Symbols**: The Scatter Respins feature is activated when a certain number of scatter symbols land on the reels, usually three or more. The scatter symbols remain locked in place while the other reels respin.

- **Sticky Scatters**: During the respins, the scatter symbols that triggered the feature are "sticky," meaning they stay in their position for the duration of the respin sequence. Each new scatter symbol that lands may also lock in place and trigger additional respins.

- **Multiple Respins**: Players typically receive a set number of respins (often 1-3) during the feature. However, landing additional scatter symbols during the respins may reset the respin count or award extra spins.

- **Bonus Round or Jackpot Trigger**: The Scatter Respins feature often leads to bigger rewards if a certain number of scatter symbols are collected. Depending on the game, collecting a specific number of scatters during the respins may trigger free spins, bonus rounds, or even jackpot prizes.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger the Feature**: The player lands a certain number of scatter symbols (e.g., 3 or more) during a regular spin, activating the Scatter Respins feature.

2. **Respins with Sticky Scatters**: The scatter symbols that triggered the feature remain locked in place. The remaining reels respin, giving the player additional chances to land more scatter symbols or high-value combinations.

3. **Additional Scatters or Wins**: If additional scatter symbols land during the respins, they also lock in place, and the respin counter may reset or add extra spins. This process continues until no more new scatter symbols land or the respins are exhausted.

4. **Bonus or Jackpot Activation**: After the respins are complete, if the player has collected enough scatter symbols, they may trigger a bonus round, free spins, or even a jackpot, depending on the game’s rules.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Scatter Respins** feature:
- The player lands three scatter symbols, activating the feature. The scatters remain sticky, and the other reels respin.
- During the respin, the player lands another scatter symbol, which locks in place and triggers another respin.
- After the respins are complete, the player has collected five scatter symbols, triggering a bonus round with free spins.

## Example Games

- **Money Train 2** by Relax Gaming: Features a scatter respin mechanic where scatters trigger respins, and additional scatters lock in place for the chance to trigger a bonus round.
- **Fire Toad** by Play’n GO: Includes scatter respins where additional scatters can lead to free spins and enhanced symbol upgrades during the bonus round.

## Conclusion

The **Scatter Respins** feature offers players extra opportunities to collect more scatter symbols, triggering potentially lucrative bonus rounds, free spins, or jackpots. By keeping scatter symbols locked in place during the respins, this mechanic enhances excitement and win potential, making it a favorite feature in many slot games. Whether it's leading to bigger wins or triggering a special feature, Scatter Respins add a layer of anticipation and thrill to the gameplay.
