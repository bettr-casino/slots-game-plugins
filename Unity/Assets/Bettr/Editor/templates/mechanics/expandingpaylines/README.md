# Expanding Paylines Mechanic

The **Expanding Paylines** mechanic is a dynamic feature in slot machines where the number of active paylines or ways to win increases during gameplay. This mechanic is usually triggered by special symbols, bonus rounds, or winning combinations, and it enhances the player's chances of winning by adding additional paylines or expanding the grid, resulting in more opportunities to land matching symbols.

## Key Features

- **Increased Paylines or Ways to Win**: When the expanding paylines mechanic is triggered, the number of active paylines or ways to win increases, allowing for more winning combinations. This could involve expanding the grid or adding new rows or reels, effectively boosting the total number of ways to win.

- **Triggered by Specific Symbols or Events**: Expanding paylines can be activated by landing certain symbols (such as scatters or special bonus symbols), achieving a series of consecutive wins, or as part of a bonus feature like free spins. In some games, this mechanic is active only in bonus rounds, while in others, it may occur during regular gameplay.

- **Significant Win Potential**: As the paylines or ways to win increase, so does the chance of landing winning combinations. This mechanic can lead to bigger payouts, especially when combined with other features like wilds, multipliers, or stacked symbols.

- **Variety in Expansion**: The expanding paylines mechanic can manifest in different ways depending on the game:
  - Adding rows or reels to the grid.
  - Unlocking additional paylines on each spin.
  - Transforming a fixed payline structure into a "ways to win" system, where adjacent symbols on consecutive reels form wins without traditional paylines.

## How It Works

1. **Base Game Setup**: The game begins with a fixed number of paylines or ways to win. Players spin the reels with a predefined grid layout and set number of paylines or winning ways.

2. **Triggering Expansion**: When specific conditions are met (such as landing a certain number of scatter symbols or triggering a free spins feature), the expanding paylines mechanic is activated, increasing the number of active paylines or ways to win.

3. **Expanded Grid**: The reel grid may expand by adding new rows or reels, or more paylines are activated. In some games, the number of paylines can grow incrementally over multiple spins or bonus rounds.

4. **Increased Winning Opportunities**: With more paylines or ways to win, the player's chances of landing winning combinations improve. If the mechanic is active during a free spins bonus, the expanded paylines may persist for the duration of the feature.

## Example

In a slot featuring the **Expanding Paylines** mechanic:
- The game starts with 243 ways to win, where symbols on adjacent reels form winning combinations.
- During a bonus round, additional rows are added, increasing the number of ways to win to 1,024.
- As the paylines expand, the chance of landing multiple winning combinations and higher payouts increases.

## Example Games

- **Bonanza Megaways** by Big Time Gaming: Uses a variable reel layout with expanding paylines, where the number of ways to win can increase to over 100,000 during the bonus feature.
- **Jumanji** by NetEnt: Features expanding paylines in its bonus rounds, where the game board can grow and offer more paylines for higher win potential.

## Conclusion

The **Expanding Paylines** mechanic adds a thrilling dimension to slot gameplay by increasing the number of ways to win, either by expanding the reel grid or unlocking additional paylines. This mechanic enhances win potential, especially when combined with other features like free spins, wilds, and multipliers, making it a favorite among players seeking dynamic and rewarding gameplay.
