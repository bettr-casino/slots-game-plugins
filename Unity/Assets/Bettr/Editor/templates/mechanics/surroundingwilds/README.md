# Surrounding Wilds Mechanic

The **Surrounding Wilds** mechanic is a slot feature where a wild symbol transforms or affects the symbols surrounding it, turning adjacent symbols into wilds. This mechanic significantly increases the chances of forming winning combinations as it enhances multiple positions around the wild. Surrounding wilds can be triggered by landing specific wild symbols or as part of a bonus round or special feature.

## Key Features

- **Transforming Adjacent Symbols**: When the surrounding wilds mechanic is triggered, a wild symbol either spreads or transforms nearby symbols into additional wilds, increasing the number of wild symbols on the reels. These wilds substitute for other symbols to create or improve winning combinations.

- **Triggering the Feature**: Surrounding wilds can be activated randomly during the base game or as part of a special bonus feature. Some slots trigger this mechanic by landing a specific wild symbol that has the ability to affect adjacent positions.

- **Increased Win Potential**: By converting multiple symbols into wilds, this mechanic increases the likelihood of forming high-value winning combinations across numerous paylines. The more symbols that are turned into wilds, the higher the payout potential.

- **Bonus Feature Interaction**: The surrounding wilds mechanic often interacts with other features such as free spins, multipliers, or expanding reels. In some games, the surrounding wilds mechanic becomes more powerful during bonus rounds, affecting a larger area or transforming more symbols.

## How It Works

1. **Wild Activation**: When a special wild symbol lands on the reels, the surrounding wilds mechanic is activated. The wild affects adjacent symbols, either spreading or transforming them into wilds.

2. **Surrounding Symbols Become Wilds**: The wild transforms the symbols directly surrounding it (typically up, down, left, right, and sometimes diagonally) into additional wild symbols. This increases the number of wilds on the grid, boosting the chances of landing winning combinations.

3. **Winning Combinations**: The newly transformed wild symbols help create or improve winning combinations across the active paylines. The more symbols that are turned into wilds, the greater the chance for significant payouts.

4. **Payout Calculation**: Once the wild transformation is complete, the game calculates the winning combinations, and the player receives their payouts.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Surrounding Wilds** mechanic:
- A wild symbol lands on reel 3, triggering the surrounding wilds feature.
- The wild spreads to the adjacent symbols in all directions, turning them into wilds.
- The new wild symbols help form multiple winning combinations across several paylines, resulting in a big payout for the player.

## Example Games

- **Golden Ticket** by Play'n GO: Features a surrounding wild mechanic where a wild symbol transforms adjacent symbols into additional wilds, increasing win potential.
- **Flowers** by NetEnt: Includes surrounding wilds during its bonus rounds, where special wilds can transform nearby symbols into wilds for larger wins.

## Conclusion

The **Surrounding Wilds** mechanic adds an exciting and rewarding twist to slot gameplay by transforming adjacent symbols into wilds, significantly increasing the player's chances of forming winning combinations. This feature can lead to large payouts, especially when combined with other mechanics like free spins or multipliers. Whether triggered randomly or during a bonus feature, surrounding wilds offer dynamic gameplay and increased win potential.
