# Stacked Wilds Mechanic

The **Stacked Wilds** mechanic is a popular slot feature where wild symbols appear stacked on top of each other on a single reel, covering multiple positions. This increases the chances of landing wilds in multiple paylines and significantly boosts the potential for winning combinations. Stacked wilds can appear in both the base game and bonus rounds, adding to the excitement and win potential.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Wild Symbols on a Single Reel**: Stacked wilds consist of two or more wild symbols that appear on the same reel, stacked vertically. In some games, these wilds can cover an entire reel, while in others, they might only partially cover it.

- **Increased Win Potential**: Because stacked wilds can span multiple rows, they create more opportunities to form winning combinations across several paylines. If the wilds cover an entire reel, it can lead to massive payouts, especially if more than one reel has stacked wilds.

- **Base and Bonus Game Integration**: Stacked wilds can appear during the base game or be part of a special bonus feature. In bonus rounds, stacked wilds may appear more frequently or have additional features, such as multipliers or sticky properties.

- **Full Reel Wilds**: In some games, stacked wilds can fill an entire reel, turning the reel into a wild reel. This increases the chances of landing multiple wild reels for bigger payouts.

## How It Works

1. **Stacked Appearance**: During a spin, wild symbols land on a reel in a stacked formation, covering multiple positions on the same reel. Depending on the game, the stack may cover 2, 3, or even more rows on the reel.

2. **Winning Potential**: Since wild symbols substitute for other symbols, the stacked wilds can help form winning combinations across multiple paylines. If the wilds cover an entire reel, this significantly increases the chances of landing high-value wins.

3. **Full Wild Reels**: If the entire reel is covered by wilds, it becomes a "wild reel," maximizing the chance for big payouts. Multiple wild reels can lead to even larger wins, particularly in games with many paylines or ways to win.

4. **Bonus Integration**: In some games, stacked wilds are more frequent or have enhanced features (like multipliers or sticky properties) during free spins or bonus rounds, adding extra excitement and win potential.

## Example

In a slot featuring **Stacked Wilds**:
- A reel shows three stacked wild symbols, covering the first three rows of the reel.
- These wilds substitute for any missing symbols in the active paylines, forming multiple winning combinations across several lines.
- If multiple reels have stacked wilds, the win potential increases dramatically, especially if they land on high-value paylines.

## Example Games

- **Starburst** by NetEnt: Features stacked wilds that expand to cover the entire reel and trigger re-spins for more win opportunities.
- **Cleopatra** by IGT: Includes stacked wilds in both the base game and free spins, enhancing the chances of landing high-value wins.

## Conclusion

The **Stacked Wilds** mechanic is a thrilling feature that increases the chances of landing multiple winning combinations by stacking wild symbols vertically on a reel. Whether appearing in the base game or in special bonus features, stacked wilds add significant win potential, especially when they cover entire reels or appear across multiple reels. This feature is especially powerful in games with many paylines or ways to win.
