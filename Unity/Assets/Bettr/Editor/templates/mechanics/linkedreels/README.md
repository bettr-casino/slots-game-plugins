# Linked Reels Mechanic

The **Linked Reels** mechanic is a feature in slot games where two or more reels are "linked" or synchronized, meaning that they spin together and display identical or nearly identical symbols, increasing the chances of forming winning combinations. This mechanic enhances the player's winning potential by effectively duplicating certain reels, making it easier to land matching symbols across multiple paylines.

## Key Features

- **Synchronized Reels**: In the Linked Reels mechanic, two or more adjacent reels are linked together. When the reels spin, they display the same or similar symbols in the same order, dramatically increasing the chances of forming winning combinations.

- **Triggered by Specific Symbols or Conditions**: Unlike some slot games where Linked Reels are triggered randomly, this design triggers the feature when **two or more Wild symbols land on adjacent reels**. Once the triggering symbols land and the payout is calculated, the affected reels become linked and spin together in the next spin.

- **High Win Potential**: By having multiple reels showing the same symbols, players have a much higher chance of landing winning combinations across the reels, especially if high-value symbols or wilds appear on the linked reels.

- **Bonus Round Enhancements**: In many games, the Linked Reels mechanic becomes more prominent during bonus rounds, where additional reels may link together, creating even more opportunities for large payouts.

## How It Works

1. **Triggering the Feature**: The Linked Reels mechanic is activated when **two or more Wild symbols land on adjacent reels** during a base game spin. After the payout for that spin, the affected reels become linked for the next spin.

2. **Linked Reels Spin Together**: In the following spin, the linked reels spin simultaneously, displaying the same or nearly identical symbols. As they land, the linked reels show the same sequence of symbols, increasing the chances of matching symbols across multiple paylines.

3. **Winning Combinations**: Once the reels stop, the game evaluates the winning combinations based on the linked reels. Since the reels display the same symbols, the likelihood of hitting large winning combinations is significantly higher.

4. **Bonus Round Interaction**: In some games, the Linked Reels mechanic expands during free spins or bonus rounds, where more than two reels can become linked, providing even greater chances for massive wins.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Linked Reels** mechanic:
- Two Wild symbols land on Reels 2 and 3, triggering the feature.
- After the payout for that spin, Reels 2 and 3 are linked for the next spin.
- During the following spin, both linked reels show the same symbols, helping the player form multiple winning combinations across the paylines.
- If additional reels link during a bonus round, the win potential increases even further, leading to larger payouts.

## Example Games

- **Custom Slot Design**: In this specific implementation, the Linked Reels mechanic is triggered when Wild symbols land on adjacent reels, linking those reels for the next spin.
- **Twin Spin** by NetEnt: A classic example of the Linked Reels mechanic, where at least two adjacent reels are linked on every spin, with the possibility of more reels becoming linked for bigger wins.
- **Twin Spin Megaways** by NetEnt: An enhanced version of the original Twin Spin with a Megaways twist, where the linked reels mechanic remains a central feature, offering high win potential.

## Conclusion

The **Linked Reels** mechanic adds a dynamic and exciting twist to slot gameplay by synchronizing adjacent reels after specific triggering conditions, such as two Wild symbols landing on adjacent reels. Whether triggered by symbols or during bonus rounds, linked reels create thrilling moments and offer significant win potential, especially when multiple reels are linked. This mechanic keeps gameplay engaging and rewarding for players looking for bigger payouts.
