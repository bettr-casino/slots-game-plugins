# Locked Reels Mechanic

The **Locked Reels** mechanic is a feature in slot machines where certain reels become "locked" together, causing them to spin in sync for a number of spins or during specific bonus rounds. When reels are locked, they display identical symbols, increasing the chances of forming high-paying winning combinations across multiple paylines. This mechanic can be triggered by specific conditions, such as landing a special symbol, or as part of a bonus round like free spins.

## Key Features

- **Synchronized Reels**: When the locked reels mechanic is triggered, two or more adjacent reels are locked together and spin in unison, showing identical symbols. This synchronized spinning boosts the chances of landing matching symbols across multiple paylines.

- **Triggered by Special Symbol**: In this design, the Locked Reels feature is triggered when a **special symbol lands on Reel 1**. When activated, adjacent reels lock together for the next spin and display the same set of symbols.

- **Increased Winning Potential**: Since the locked reels display identical symbols, the probability of forming winning combinations on multiple paylines increases significantly. If high-value symbols or wilds land on the locked reels, the potential payouts can be substantial.

- **Bonus Round Enhancement**: In some games, the locked reels mechanic becomes more frequent or impactful during bonus rounds or free spins, increasing the chances of landing big wins.

## How It Works

1. **Reel Lock Activation**: The locked reels mechanic is triggered when a **special symbol lands on Reel 1**. After the payout for that spin, adjacent reels lock together for the next spin.

2. **Synchronized Symbols**: Once the reels lock, they spin and stop together, displaying the same set of symbols on the locked reels. This synchronization boosts the chance of landing matching symbols across multiple paylines.

3. **Payouts**: After the reels stop, the player is paid for any winning combinations formed by the locked reels, often leading to larger payouts, especially if high-paying symbols are involved.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Locked Reels** mechanic:
- A **special symbol lands on Reel 1**, triggering the Locked Reels feature.
- Reels 2 and 3 lock together for the next spin and spin in sync.
- When the reels stop, both locked reels display identical high-paying symbols, significantly increasing the chances of winning across multiple paylines.
- The player is awarded a big payout due to the matching symbols across the locked reels.

## Example Games

- **Custom Slot Design**: In this specific implementation, the Locked Reels mechanic is triggered when a special symbol lands on Reel 1, linking adjacent reels for the next spin.
- **Twin Spin** by NetEnt: A well-known game that features the locked reels mechanic in every spin, where at least two adjacent reels are locked together and spin with identical symbols.
- **Dragon's Fire Megaways** by Red Tiger Gaming: Features locked reels during free spins, where reels lock together to display matching symbols, boosting win potential.

## Conclusion

The **Locked Reels** mechanic is an exciting and rewarding feature that increases the chances of landing big wins by locking two or more reels together and displaying identical symbols. Whether triggered by a special symbol or as part of a bonus feature, the synchronized reels create more opportunities for high-value combinations, making this mechanic a favorite among players looking for enhanced payout potential and thrilling gameplay.
