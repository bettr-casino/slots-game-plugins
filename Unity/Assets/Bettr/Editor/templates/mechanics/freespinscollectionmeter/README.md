# Free Spins Collection Meter Mechanic

The **Free Spins Collection Meter** mechanic is a feature in slot games where players accumulate special symbols or points to fill a meter. Once the meter is filled, the player is rewarded with free spins or entry into a free spins bonus round. This mechanic adds an element of progression to the gameplay, offering an engaging and rewarding way for players to unlock valuable free spins by collecting specific symbols over multiple spins.

## Key Features

- **Progressive Collection**: Players collect specific symbols (e.g., scatters, special bonus symbols, or points) over multiple spins to fill a collection meter. As the meter fills, it tracks progress toward unlocking a free spins round or bonus feature.

- **Unlocking Free Spins**: Once the collection meter is filled, the player is rewarded with a set number of free spins. In some games, the number of free spins or their value (such as multipliers) increases as the meter progresses.

- **Persistence Over Multiple Spins**: Unlike standard free spins triggers that require landing specific symbols on a single spin, the collection meter mechanic allows progress to be made over time, adding excitement and anticipation as players work toward filling the meter.

- **Bonus Round Enhancement**: Some games may allow players to collect additional symbols or bonuses during the free spins round itself, further enhancing the rewards. In certain cases, the collection meter may continue to grow during free spins, offering extended or enhanced rewards.

## How It Works

1. **Symbol Collection**: The player spins the reels, and certain symbols (such as scatters, special collection symbols, or points) contribute to filling the free spins collection meter. These symbols may appear randomly or require specific conditions to be met.

2. **Meter Progression**: As symbols are collected, the meter fills up. The player can usually track their progress via a visible meter or progress bar displayed on the game screen.

3. **Free Spins Trigger**: Once the collection meter is full, the free spins round is triggered. Depending on the game, the number of free spins may be predetermined or increase based on how full the meter is.

4. **Additional Rewards**: Some games allow for continued collection during the free spins round, offering further enhancements like extra spins, multipliers, or additional bonuses.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Free Spins Collection Meter** mechanic:
- A player collects special "Orb" symbols over multiple spins, and each orb fills part of the free spins collection meter.
- After collecting 10 orbs, the meter is full, and the player is awarded 15 free spins.
- During the free spins, the player can continue collecting more orbs, which add additional free spins or apply a multiplier to the winnings.

## Example Games

- **Reactoonz** by Play'n GO: Features a collection meter that fills as players accumulate winning combinations. Once full, the meter triggers various bonuses, including free spins.
- **Jammin' Jars 2** by Push Gaming: Includes a collection mechanic where players collect coins to fill a meter and trigger the Giga Jar feature, which can award free spins.

## Conclusion

The **Free Spins Collection Meter** mechanic adds an exciting sense of progression and anticipation to slot games, giving players a tangible goal as they collect symbols over multiple spins. By filling the meter, players unlock valuable free spins or bonus rounds, often with additional enhancements like multipliers or extra rewards. This mechanic keeps players engaged by offering an ongoing reward system that builds excitement as the meter fills and the free spins round approaches.
