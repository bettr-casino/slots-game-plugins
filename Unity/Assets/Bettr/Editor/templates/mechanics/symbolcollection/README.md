# Symbol Collection Mechanic

The **Symbol Collection** mechanic is a feature in slot games where players collect specific symbols over multiple spins or rounds to unlock rewards, trigger bonus rounds, or enhance their win potential. This mechanic often adds an element of progression to the gameplay, as players work toward gathering a certain number of symbols or filling a collection meter. Once the required symbols are collected, players are rewarded with free spins, bonus features, multipliers, or even jackpot prizes.

## Key Features

- **Progressive Collection**: Players collect designated symbols over a series of spins, and their progress is tracked in a visible meter or counter. The collected symbols accumulate over time, and once a specific number of symbols is reached, a reward or bonus feature is triggered.

- **Multiple Triggers**: The Symbol Collection mechanic may lead to different outcomes depending on the number of symbols collected. For example, collecting 3 symbols may trigger free spins, while collecting 10 symbols could unlock a jackpot or super bonus round.

- **Bonus Round Activation**: Many games use Symbol Collection to trigger bonus rounds, such as free spins or special mini-games. During these rounds, the collection mechanic may continue, allowing players to gather additional symbols for enhanced rewards.

- **Persistent Progress**: In some games, symbol collection progress carries over between sessions, allowing players to build up their collection over multiple gaming sessions until the bonus is triggered. In other games, the collection resets after the bonus feature is activated.

## How It Works

1. **Collecting Symbols**: As the player spins the reels, specific symbols (e.g., coins, gems, or other themed icons) appear on the reels. When these symbols land, they are added to the player's collection meter or counter.

2. **Filling the Meter**: With each collected symbol, the meter fills up. Once the player has collected the required number of symbols, the bonus round, free spins, or reward is triggered.

3. **Triggering the Bonus**: When the collection meter is filled, players are awarded the designated reward. Depending on the game, the reward could be free spins, bonus rounds, multipliers, or a jackpot.

4. **Further Collection During Bonuses**: In some games, the Symbol Collection mechanic continues during bonus rounds, where collecting additional symbols can enhance the reward, extend the feature, or apply multipliers to the winnings.

## Example

In a game featuring the **Symbol Collection** mechanic:
- The player collects "Gem" symbols with each spin, which fill up a progress meter.
- After collecting 10 gems, the meter is full, and the player is awarded 10 free spins.
- During the free spins round, the player continues to collect gems, which may increase the win multiplier or award additional spins.

## Example Games

- **Jammin’ Jars 2** by Push Gaming: Features a symbol collection mechanic where players collect special coins to fill a meter. Once the meter is full, it triggers the Giga Jar feature with the chance for massive payouts.
- **Legacy of Egypt** by Play’n GO: Includes a symbol collection mechanic during the free spins round, where collecting certain symbols increases the number of spins or enhances multipliers.

## Conclusion

The **Symbol Collection** mechanic adds a layer of progression and excitement to slot gameplay by giving players the opportunity to collect symbols over multiple spins or rounds. As symbols are collected, players work toward unlocking bonus features, free spins, or other rewards, making the gameplay more engaging and rewarding. This mechanic encourages players to keep spinning and adds anticipation as they get closer to filling the collection meter and triggering lucrative rewards.
