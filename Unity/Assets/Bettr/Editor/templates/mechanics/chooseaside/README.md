# Choose A Side Mechanic

The "Choose A Side" mechanic is an exciting and unique feature in slot machines that offers players the choice between two competing sides, typically represented as "Good" and "Evil." This feature introduces a strategic element into the base game, where each spin contributes toward one of two outcomes, and the player wins a jackpot depending on which side wins.

## Key Features

- **Choose Good or Evil**: At the beginning of each round, the player selects either the "Good" or "Evil" character. Once the choice is made, the player is locked into their chosen side for that round. A new round begins when one side wins, allowing the player to choose again.

- **+1 / -1 Mechanic**: With each spin, there is a random chance of either a +1 or -1 being added to the respective counter. The +1s advance the "Good" side, while the -1s advance the "Evil" side. These counters are separate and accumulate toward a threshold.

- **Jackpot Threshold**: The goal is to reach a specific threshold for either the "Good" or "Evil" side:
  - If the "Good" side reaches the threshold first (with +1s), the player wins a **personal jackpot**.
  - If the "Evil" side reaches the threshold first (with -1s), the player wins a **global jackpot** (or the predefined "Evil" prize).
  
- **Round Reset**: Once a threshold is reached and the jackpot is won, the feature is reset, and a new round begins. The player can then choose between "Good" or "Evil" again for the next round.

- **Consistent Choice Per Round**: Players cannot switch between the "Good" and "Evil" sides once a round has begun. The choice made at the start of the round remains locked until that round concludes.

## How It Works

1. **Choose a Side**: At the beginning of a round, the player chooses either the "Good" or "Evil" character. This choice determines which jackpot they are aiming for.

2. **Accumulate Points**: With every spin, there is a random chance for either a +1 (moving "Good" closer to the threshold) or a -1 (moving "Evil" closer to the threshold).

3. **Threshold Reached**: Once the cumulative total of +1s or -1s reaches the predefined threshold, the corresponding side wins:
   - If the "Good" side wins, the player wins the **personal jackpot**.
   - If the "Evil" side wins, the player wins the **global jackpot** or another defined prize.

4. **Round Reset**: After a jackpot is won, the counters reset, and the player can select "Good" or "Evil" again for the new round.

## Example

- At the start of the game, the player selects the "Evil" side. As spins progress, the game randomly assigns +1s and -1s.
- After several spins, the -1s accumulate and reach the threshold before the +1s, meaning the "Evil" side wins.
- The player wins the global jackpot, and the feature resets for the next round, allowing them to choose "Good" or "Evil" again.

## Conclusion

The "Choose A Side" mechanic adds an interactive layer of choice and anticipation to the slot game. By selecting between "Good" and "Evil," players engage in a tug-of-war between the two sides, with the chance to win different jackpots depending on their choice. Each round provides a fresh opportunity to pick a side, creating variety and excitement with every spin.
