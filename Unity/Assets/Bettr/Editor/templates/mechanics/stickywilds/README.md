# Sticky Wilds Mechanics

Sticky Wilds is a popular slot machine mechanic where wild symbols, once they appear, remain "stuck" in place for a certain number of spins or until a specific feature ends. This feature is often triggered either during a special in-game bonus or in a free spins round, enhancing the player's chances of forming winning combinations.

## Key Features

- **Wild Symbols Stay in Place**: When a wild symbol lands on the reels, it remains in the same position for multiple spins or until the triggered feature concludes. This increases the likelihood of winning combinations during the feature.

- **Triggered by Bonuses or Free Spins**: Sticky Wilds are usually part of a bonus feature, such as free spins or a specific game mode. Once the feature is activated, any wilds that land during this period become sticky and remain in place.

- **Increased Win Potential**: With wild symbols staying in position across multiple spins, the chances of forming high-value combinations are significantly boosted. The more sticky wilds that appear, the greater the win potential.

- **Sticky Wild Feature Duration**: The sticky wilds will remain in place either until the bonus feature ends or after a predetermined number of spins (depending on the specific game). Once the feature or free spins end, the wilds revert to their normal behavior.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger the Feature**: Sticky wilds are typically triggered by landing special symbols or activating a bonus round, such as free spins.
  
2. **Wilds Become Sticky**: When a wild symbol lands during the feature, it remains fixed in place for the duration of the feature or a set number of spins.

3. **Additional Sticky Wilds**: Any additional wilds that land during the feature will also become sticky, remaining in place alongside the original sticky wilds until the feature concludes.

4. **End of Feature**: Once the free spins or bonus feature ends, the sticky wilds are removed, and the game returns to its regular mode of play.

## Example

In a free spins round with Sticky Wilds:
- You land a wild symbol on reel 2 during the first spin of the free spins round.
- That wild remains in place (sticky) for the remaining free spins.
- If additional wilds land on the reels during the next spins, they also become sticky and stay in place for the remainder of the feature.

## Example Games

- **Dead or Alive** by NetEnt: Known for its high volatility and sticky wilds during the free spins bonus feature, where wilds stay locked for the entire round.
- **Immortal Romance** by Microgaming: Features sticky wilds in certain bonus modes, increasing win potential in free spins.

## Conclusion

Sticky Wilds bring an exciting element to slot games by giving players the opportunity to lock in wild symbols and maximize their chances of hitting winning combinations. This feature is often associated with bonus rounds or free spins, offering enhanced win potential during these special modes of play.
