## Themes

The inspiration of the Slots game theme is the story of the Ramayana and the characters of the story. 

A brief description of the theme is outlined below

### Theme colors

1. Royal Purple: Symbolizing regality and spirituality, royal purple can be used to represent the divine characters and themes of the Ramayana.
2. Saffron Orange: Inspired by the color of saffron, which holds great significance in Indian traditions, saffron orange can evoke a sense of spirituality, energy, and enthusiasm.
3. Deep Red: Representing passion, love, and power, deep red can be used to depict intense emotions and dramatic elements from the Ramayana.
4. Golden Yellow: Symbolizing prosperity, wealth, and brightness, golden yellow can bring a touch of grandeur and elegance to the theme.
5. Earthy Brown: Earthy brown tones can be used to represent the natural elements and earthly settings in the Ramayana, such as forests and landscapes.
6. Jewel Tones: Consider incorporating jewel tones like emerald green, sapphire blue, and ruby red to add depth and richness to the theme. These colors can represent the precious gemstones often associated with Indian heritage.
7. Ivory or Off-White: Using ivory or off-white shades can provide a neutral base color, creating a contrast against vibrant elements and emphasizing the cultural aspects of the theme.

### Theme structural elements

1. Ornate Borders: Use intricate and ornate borders inspired by Indian architectural designs, such as traditional motifs, mandalas, or filigree patterns. These borders can be applied to the game interface, buttons, or background elements.

3. Temples and Palaces: Include elements inspired by Indian temples and palaces in the game design. Use architectural elements like domes, arches, pillars, or intricate carvings to create a sense of grandeur and authenticity.
4. Floral and Nature Elements: Draw inspiration from India's rich natural beauty by incorporating floral patterns, lotus flowers, peacocks, elephants, or other elements found in Indian flora and fauna. These can be used as decorative elements or symbols within the game.
5. Traditional Textiles: Incorporate textures and patterns inspired by traditional Indian textiles like silk, brocade, or ikat. These textures can be used in the background, buttons, or other UI elements to add depth and visual interest.
6. Illuminated Artwork: Emulate the aesthetic of Indian illuminated manuscripts or miniature paintings by incorporating intricate details, vibrant colors, and gold accents. This can be applied to loading screens, bonus animations, or special game features.
7. Cultural Artifacts: Include representations of cultural artifacts like ancient Indian weapons, musical instruments (such as veena or tabla), traditional jewelry, or other objects of significance from the Ramayana. These can be incorporated as symbols or as part of the game's visual narrative.
